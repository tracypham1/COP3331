3.12 Vector ADT
- a vector is a class ADT in C++ STL that allow for an indexable, ordered list of items
    - empty() returns true is size is zero
    - clear() removes all elements of a vector so size is 0
        an element at position 0 DNE
    - erase(iteratorPosition) removes element at position and shifts everything after up one
    - insert(iteratorPosition, const T& x) copies x to that poisiton, shifts element at that positon and after one over, vector incriments
        - using insert sorts values in ascending order, increases down the list

 3.13 Auto (since C++11) 
 - auto is a type specifier that causes compiler to automatically deduce the type from the initialize, so
    - EX: syntax
    
        const auto x = 5; //assume x is type const int, which is legal
        auto j = 5.0; //assumes j is type double    
        auto s = "Hello"; //assume s is const char* bc its simpler than a string literal
3.14 Range Based For Loop
- range based for loops (also for each loop) iterates through each element of a vector or container
    - declares a new variable that will be assigned to each element
- to modify elements of the array, make the reading variable a type reference
    - EX: modifying for each vector loop

        for (double& gradeVal : examGrade){ //gradeVal needs to be same type as elements of ExamGrade
            double userGrade;
            cin >> userGrade;
            gradeVal = userGrade;
        }
    - use 'auto' for gradeVal 
        - a common practice with range based/for each loops
