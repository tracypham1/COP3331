9.1 Derived Classes
- The produceItem class is a subclass/derived class of genericItem
    - subclasses are exaclty the same as the base class, but with additional items
    - EX: class produceItem : public genericItem {/*...*/} ;
    - this concept is called Inheritance
- Express class inheritance, use Unified Modeling Language (UML)
    - member access: private (-), public (+), protected (#)
- Multiple variations/adaptations of class inheriting
    - EX: subclass can be a base class
            class FruitItem : public ProduceItem {/*...*/};
    - EX: class can be base to many Classes
            class FruitItem : public GenericItem {/*...*/};
    - EX: single class can have multiple bases
            class FruitItem : public ProduceItem, public GenericItem {/*...*/};
9.2 Access by Member of Derived Classes
- a subclass is does not have access to private members declared in the base class
- a third access specifier is "protected"
    - this only grants access to derived classes, no one else
- in class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {/*...*/};
    - 'public' refers to how base class specifies access of base class
    - EX: 
        public: public-->public and protected-->protected
        protected: public-->protected and protected-->protected 
            public and protected members of BaseClass are accessible as protected members of DerivedClass
        private: omitted type in header defaults to private, so class DerivedClass : BaseClass {};
9.3 Overriding Member Functions
- A derived class may have a function with same name as function in base class
    - this overrides the previous definition in the base class
- overriding is using the same name and parameters, where overloading uses different parameters
    - overriding a function allows that function to call the original base class definition
    - EX: the derived function must have a reference to previous
        class ProduceItem : public GenericItem{
            void PrintItem(){
                GenericItem::PrintItem(); //not having the reference to the base class causes a recursive call --> error
                cout << "(Expires: " << expirationDate << ")" << endl;
            }
        };
    - override-->derived class has function w same name and parameters
    - overload-->function has same name, but diff parameters; allowed to call previous definition
9.4 Polymorphism and Virtual Member Functions
- Polymorphism refers to determining which program behavior to execute based on data types
    - EX: compiler polymorphism is when the compiler determines which same named functions to call based on parameters
          runtime polymorphism is when compiler does not determine, but as the program executes, aka derived classes
- derived/base class pointer conversion, converts a pointer to a derived class to a pointer to a base class without any explicit casting
    - a vector of BaseClass functions > vector.push_back(DerivedClass) 
    - the element only holds base class members 
    - since both base and derived class have print statements, to call the correct one append virtual before a function
- pure virtual Functions
    - EX: class GenericItem {
            ...
            virtual void PrintItem() = 0;
            ...
        };    
        //pure virtual function means function is defined in a derived class
        //a class that has at least one pure virtual function is an abstract base class 
- objects cant be made with abstract base classes
- this abstract base class makes subclasses more uniform including collection of those objects via polymorphism
    - if derived classes do not override the abstract base class with the pure virtual function, that derived subclass becomes abstract as well
- virtual keyword used when we have pointers to objects (base or derived) to tell compiler which function definition to use
- possible warnings when using virtual functions:
    - inventory.cpp:6: warning: 'class GenericItem' has virtual functions but non-virtual destructor
    - inventory.cpp:19: warning: 'class ProduceItem' has virtual functions but non-virtual destructor
9.5 Is-a versus has-a Relationship
- inheritance is not composition, composition is using objects of other classes within a class
    - composition refers to a class object 'has-a' member with another class object
    - EX: inheritance-->MotherClass 'is-a' type of PersonClass
10.1 Exception Basics
- Error-checking code is code programmers write to detect and handle errors during program execution
- an exception is a circumstance the program was not designed to handle, such as when the user enters a negative number
- ifelse statements obscure code and can cause redundancies
- exception-handling constructs use special keywords to keep error checking codes separate
