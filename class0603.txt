5.20 Static Data Members and Functions
- static variables are allocated in memory only once
    - have a global scope, accessible anywhere in the program if public
    - access using the scope resolution operator :: 
    - EX: value = Class::staticDataMember
- in classes, static data members independent of class instances/objects
    - that means these data members can be accessed without creating an object
- static member functions can only access static data members bc 'this' isnt passed. making it independent from instances/objects of the class
    - used to access private static members from outside class
    - EX: Class::getPrivateStaticMember()
    - 'this' refers to a specific class object, so it can not be passed to static functions
    - neither can it be used or returned by a static function
Questions
- so the this parameter is a local reference to the object that is being created? mroe info?
